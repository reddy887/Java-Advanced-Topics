                    HEAP MEMORY VS STRING POOL IN JAVA
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--heap memory--
-->Heap memory is the part of JVM memory where all java objects are stored during runtime.
-->It is used for dynamic memory allocation.
-->Every time you create an object using 'new', its goes to the heap.
-->String created using 'new string ("abc")' are also stored in heap (not in string pool).
-->Garbage collector manages heap memory and clears unused objects.
Example :-
  String str1 =new String ("hello");//stored in heap
